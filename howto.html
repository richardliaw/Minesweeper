        <strong>Overview</strong>
        <br>The object of the game is to clear a minefield of mines. 
        <br>By clicking on bricks, the player learns if the brick contains a bomb. If they do not see a bomb, the game continues.
        <br>When the player clicks on a brick, a number may appear. The number shows how many bombs are next to this square. 
        <br>This helps the player find out where the bombs are.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>How to play</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        The rules in Minesweeper are simple:
        <ul>
            <li>Uncover a mine, and the game ends.</li>
            <li>Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.</li>
            <li>Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>Hints and tips</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Mark the mines. If you suspect a square conceals a mine, right-click it. This puts a flag on the square. (If you're not sure, right-click again to make it a question mark.)</li>
            <li>Study the patterns. If three squares in a row display 2-3-2, then you know three mines are probably lined up beside that row. If a square says 8, every surrounding square is mined.</li>
            <li>Explore the unexplored. Not sure where to click next? Try clearing some unexplored territory. You're better off clicking in the middle of unmarked squares than in an area you suspect is mined</li>
        </ul>
